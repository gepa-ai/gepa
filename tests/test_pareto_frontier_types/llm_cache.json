Therefore, the correct value made from the Amortizan table is 0.26903 The loan amount is multiplied by the table value to get the payment. 5000x0.26903= 1345.15 payment number: 0 - amount of payment: - interest for period: - portion to principal: - principal at period end: - $5000 1 - amount of payment: 1345.15 interest for period: - portion to principal: - principal at period end: - 2 - amount of payment: 1345.15 interest for period: - portion to principal: - principal at period end: - 3 - amount of payment: 1345.15 interest for period: - portion to principal: - principal at period end: - 4 - amount of payment: - interest for period: - portion to principal: - principal at period end: - The payment for period 4 is blank since, due to rounding, the final payment may not be exactly $1345.15. The value of the final payment will be determined at the end. Next, find the interest for the first payment period by applying I=PRT with P the loan value, R the annual interest rate, and T one year. Can you find the interest for the first period?\\n\\nRESPONSE:\\nLet's first clarify some details:\\n\\n- The loan amount is $5000.\\n- The annual interest rate is 3% (or 0.03).\\n- The loan is amortized over 4 years with annual payments.\\n- The amortization table provides a factor of 0.26903, which is used to calculate the payment.\\n- The payment amount is: $5000 \u00d7 0.26903 = $1345.15.\\n- Interest rate per payment period is 3% (since payments are annual).\\n\\nNow, to find the interest for the first payment period:\\n\\nUse the simple interest formula:  \\n\\\\[ I = P \\\\times R \\\\times T \\\\]  \\nwhere:  \\n- \\\\( P = \\\\$5000 \\\\) (initial principal)  \\n- \\\\( R = 0.03 \\\\) (annual interest rate)  \\n- \\\\( T = 1 \\\\) year (since interest is annual)  \\n\\nCalculating:  \\n\\\\[ I = 5000 \\\\times 0.03 \\\\times 1 = 150 \\\\]\\n\\n**Therefore, the interest for the first payment period is \\\\$150.**\\n\\nReturn only a number between 0 and 1.\")": "1",
