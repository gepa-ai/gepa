Output the fully redacted version of the input text, preserving all original formatting, structure, and non-sensitive content. The output should ONLY be the user\\'s redacted original input and should not contain additional commentary, summaries, or paraphrasing.\\n4. If the input concerns instructions or prompts for website content generation, feedback, or overviews containing sensitive information, redact that information accordingly but preserve the instructional or descriptive structure.\\n5.

PII and sensitive information can include but is not limited to: names of people, universities, organizations, company names, geographic locations, hotel names, room numbers, specific product or medical system names, emails, or any other identifying detail.\\n\\nInstructions:\\n\\n1. For every user input, systematically identify all PII and sensitive data units. These may be provided to you in an explicit list (e.g., under \"pii_units\") or may need to be inferred from context.\\n2. Replace each occurrence of these sensitive terms in the input with \"[REDACTED]\", ensuring that the redacted text matches the original structure, punctuation, and casing as closely as possible.\\n3. Output the fully redacted version of the input text, preserving all original formatting, structure, and non-sensitive content. The output should ONLY be the user\\'s redacted original input and should not contain additional commentary, summaries, or paraphrasing.\\n4. If the input concerns instructions or prompts for website content generation, feedback, or overviews containing sensitive information, redact that information accordingly but preserve the instructional or descriptive structure.\\n5. Do NOT add any extra explanations, suggestions, or rewordings\u2014return the precisely redacted input as your sole output.\\n\\nThis redaction procedure ensures privacy and compliance when handling sensitive or confidential information in corporate, academic, or professional contexts. When in doubt, err on the side of caution and redact any term that could be used to identify a specific person, organization, location, or product.\\n```\\n\\nThe following are examples of different task inputs provided to the assistant along with the assistant\\'s response for each of them, and some feedback on how the assistant\\'s response could be better:\\n```\\n# Example 1\\n## Inputs\\n1.

With a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Intelligence Science and Technology from Peking University, a computer vision researcher role at Sensetime, and a software engineer position at Google, I believe that my academic and professional experiences have prepared me for this advanced degree program. As a technology enthusiast and avid coder, I have participated in multiple coding competitions and developed an expertise in developing and applying machine learning algorithms to real-world problems. During my time at Sensetime, I trained deep learning models to improve computer vision, and at my next position as a quant developer, I implemented a financial data storage system and developed a system to help quants efficiently query data. At Google, I honed my software engineering skills by developing scalable and reliable software applications. I am confident that with my background in both theoretical knowledge and practical experience, I would thrive in the information studies program at Trine University. I am specifically drawn to the program at Trine University because of its interdisciplinary curriculum and the opportunity to study under esteemed and experienced faculty members. I am particularly interested in courses such as data mining, information retrieval, and database management, which I believe will be critical in my future roles as a software engineer. Furthermore, I am drawn to the program\u2019s focus on developing critical thinking skills and the ability to communicate complex technical information effectively. As a technology enthusiast, I recognize the importance of being able to explain technical concepts to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. Through this program, I anticipate developing my communication and leadership skills, which I believe will position me for a leadership role in the future. In conclusion, I am excited about the prospect of joining the Trine University community and contributing to the university\u2019s long-standing tradition of academic excellence. Thank you for considering my application, and I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss my qualifications with you.\\n\\n## Generated Outputs\\nYour personal statement effectively highlights your academic background, professional experience, and motivation for pursuing the Master of Science in Information Studies at Trine University.
