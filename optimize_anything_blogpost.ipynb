        "# `optimize_anything`: A Universal API for Text-Based Optimization\n",
        "\n",
        "**TL;DR**: We introduce `optimize_anything`, a single, declarative API that uses LLMs as intelligent proposers to optimize *anything* representable as text—code, prompts, configurations, agent architectures. The key insight: if it can be serialized to text, an LLM can reason about it and propose improvements. The secret sauce? **A**uxiliary **S**ide **I**nformation (ASI).\n",

        "## Key Takeaways\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Unified Interface**: Whether you're optimizing prompts, code, hyperparameters, or agent architectures, the API is the same—just provide a `seed_candidate` (starting point) and a `fitness_fn` (how good are we doing?).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **The Convex Hull of Optimization**: `optimize_anything` is designed to be the \"convex hull\" of all text-based optimization problems. Different libraries optimize different things (Optuna for hyperparameters, evolutionary strategies for algorithms, gradient descent for neural networks). We unify them under one abstraction.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Side Information is Key**: Unlike traditional optimizers that only see scalar scores, GEPA's LLM-based reflection can understand *why* a candidate performed poorly through rich diagnostic information—error messages, execution traces, partial results.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Emergent Capabilities**: GEPA can discover sophisticated strategies (like self-refinement) that weren't explicitly programmed—they emerge from the optimization process itself.\n",
