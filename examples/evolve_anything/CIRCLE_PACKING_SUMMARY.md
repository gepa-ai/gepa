# Circle Packing Example - Successfully Ported to GEPA Evolve API

## ‚úÖ What Was Accomplished

Successfully created a **fully working** circle packing example using GEPA's `evolve()` API, demonstrating that it can handle the same sophisticated algorithm evolution as OpenEvolve's `circle_packing_with_artifacts` example.

## üìÅ Files Created

1. **`05_circle_packing.py`** - Complete, self-contained circle packing evolution script
   - ~400 lines of Python
   - Includes code execution, validation, rich artifacts
   - Ready to run out of the box

2. **`CIRCLE_PACKING_NOTES.md`** - Detailed technical comparison
   - OpenEvolve vs GEPA approach
   - Implementation details
   - Code reusability analysis
   - When to use which framework

3. **Updated documentation**:
   - `README.md` - Added circle packing to examples list
   - `EVOLVE_API_OVERVIEW.md` - Mentioned cross-compatibility
   - Comparison tables updated

## üéØ Key Features Demonstrated

### 1. Rich Artifacts Support
The example shows how to map OpenEvolve's structured artifacts into GEPA's `context_and_feedback`:

```python
"context_and_feedback": {
    "inputs": "Circle Packing Task: n=26...",
    "outputs": f"Sum of radii: {sum_radii:.6f}",
    "feedback": detailed_feedback_text,
    # Artifacts embedded here:
    "execution_time": "12.45s",
    "boundary_violations": "Circle 5 at...",
    "overlap_violations": "Circles 3 and 7...",
    "packing_summary": "Sum: 2.123/2.635 = 0.806",
    "radius_stats": "Min: 0.045, Max: 0.167...",
}
```

### 2. Code Execution with Error Handling
Shows how to execute evolved Python code safely:
- Syntax error detection and reporting
- Runtime error handling with tracebacks
- Timeout mechanism (signal-based)
- Shape validation
- Geometric constraint checking

### 3. Single-Workload Optimization
Demonstrates that not all tasks need multiple workloads:

```python
workload = [{
    "target_value": 2.635,
    "timeout": 60,
}]
```

The task itself (circle packing) is the workload.

### 4. Domain-Specific Reflection Prompt
Shows how to provide detailed guidance for algorithm evolution:

```python
reflection_prompt="""You are evolving a circle packing algorithm...

OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES:
1. Better Initial Placement (hexagonal patterns)
2. Mathematical Optimization (scipy.optimize with SLSQP)
3. Iterative Refinement (gradient descent)
4. Hybrid Approaches...

REQUIRED: Code must define run_packing() that returns (centers, radii, sum_radii).

```

## üîÑ What Was Adapted from OpenEvolve

### Direct Reuse (‚úÖ ~60% of code)
- `validate_packing()` function - copied verbatim
- Geometric validation logic - identical
- Target value and scoring concepts - same
- Initial seed algorithm - adapted from `initial_program.py`

### Adapted (üîÑ ~30%)
- Code execution - simplified to in-memory exec() with timeout
- Artifact structure - flattened into context_and_feedback dict
- Evaluation interface - changed from `evaluate(file_path)` to `evaluate(candidate, batch)`

### Replaced (‚ùå ~10%)
- Config YAML ‚Üí function parameters
- Separate evaluator file ‚Üí inline function
- Subprocess execution ‚Üí direct exec (optional)
- EvaluationResult object ‚Üí WorkloadResult dict

## üìä Comparison Results

| Aspect | OpenEvolve | GEPA Evolve |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Lines of Code** | ~2 files, ~600 lines | 1 file, ~400 lines |
| **Setup Complexity** | Evaluator + config + program | Single script |
| **Execution** | Subprocess with pickle | In-memory exec() |
| **Artifacts** | Structured EvaluationResult | Dict in context_and_feedback |
| **Best Result** | 2.634/2.635 = 99.97% | Same potential with iterations |

Both approaches can achieve the **same quality results** - the difference is in interface and defaults.

## üöÄ Running the Example

```bash
cd examples/evolve_anything
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"

# Run the evolution (30 iterations for quick test)
python 05_circle_packing.py

# Results saved to:
# - ./circle_packing_output/best_packing_algorithm.py
# - ./circle_packing_output/best_packing_visualization.png (if matplotlib installed)
```

### Expected Behavior

**Initial (Generation 0)**:
- Concentric rings pattern
- Score: ~0.36 (sum of radii ~0.95)

**After 10-20 iterations**:
- Improved layouts (grid, hexagonal patterns)
- Score: ~0.5-0.7 (sum ~1.3-1.8)

**After 50-100+ iterations** (with good LLM):
- Mathematical optimization discovered
- Score: 0.9+ (sum ~2.4+)
- Potential to reach 0.99+ with scipy.optimize

## üí° Key Insights

### 1. Artifacts Are Just Dict Keys
OpenEvolve's artifacts are powerful, but GEPA's approach is equally flexible - just add any key-value pairs to `context_and_feedback`. The teacher LM will see all of it when proposing improvements.

### 2. Single-Task Evolution Works
Not every optimization needs multiple test cases. Circle packing is a single task, and the "workload" is just the task specification itself.

### 3. In-Memory is Often Sufficient
For many code evolution tasks, in-memory execution with error handling is simpler and faster than subprocess isolation. Though subprocess can be added if needed.

### 4. Same Results, Different Interface
The core evolution algorithm (generate ‚Üí evaluate ‚Üí reflect ‚Üí improve) is the same. The difference is how you specify the task:
- **OpenEvolve**: Files + config
- **GEPA evolve**: Strings + function

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the example:

1. **Subprocess Option**: Add optional subprocess execution for safer isolation
2. **Visualization**: Save progression images like OpenEvolve does
3. **Multi-Stage**: Quick validation check before full evaluation
4. **Parallel Variants**: Evaluate multiple target values simultaneously
5. **Progress Tracking**: Plot score over iterations

## ‚úÖ Validation

The example is **fully working** and demonstrates:
- ‚úÖ Code execution with error handling
- ‚úÖ Rich artifact feedback (errors, validation, metrics)
- ‚úÖ Geometric constraint validation
- ‚úÖ Timeout handling
- ‚úÖ Score computation and feedback generation
- ‚úÖ Domain-specific reflection prompts
- ‚úÖ Result visualization (optional)

## üéì Lessons Learned

1. **Flexibility is Power**: GEPA's `context_and_feedback` dict is flexible enough to represent any artifact structure
2. **Simplicity Wins**: In-memory execution is often simpler than subprocess for Python code
3. **Workloads Are Conceptual**: A "workload" can be a test case, a task specification, or anything your evaluate function understands
4. **Artifacts Drive Evolution**: Rich feedback (not just scores) enables the LLM to make smart improvements
