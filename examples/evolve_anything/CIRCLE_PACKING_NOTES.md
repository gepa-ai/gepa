# Circle Packing Example: OpenEvolve ‚Üí GEPA Evolve API

## What Was Ported

Successfully ported OpenEvolve's `circle_packing_with_artifacts` example to GEPA's `evolve()` API, demonstrating that the API can handle sophisticated algorithm evolution with rich artifact feedback.

## Key Differences from OpenEvolve

### OpenEvolve Approach
- **Input**: File path to Python code
- **Evaluation**: Separate `evaluator.py` file with `evaluate(program_path)` function
- **Execution**: Subprocess with timeout, writes to temp files
- **Artifacts**: Returns `EvaluationResult(metrics, artifacts)` object
- **Configuration**: YAML config with system messages, population, islands

### GEPA Evolve API Approach
- **Input**: In-memory string (candidate["packing_algorithm"])
- **Evaluation**: Inline `evaluate_circle_packing(candidate, batch)` function
- **Execution**: In-memory exec() with signal timeout (or threading for cross-platform)
- **Artifacts**: Embedded in `context_and_feedback` dict within WorkloadResult
- **Configuration**: Function arguments + reflection_prompt string

## Implementation Details

### 1. Workload Design

Since circle packing is a **single task** (not multiple test cases), the workload is simply:

```python
workload = [
    {
        "target_value": 2.635,  # AlphaEvolve result
        "timeout": 60,
    }
]
```

This is passed to the evaluate function, which processes it as a batch of size 1.

### 2. Code Execution

OpenEvolve uses subprocess execution:
```python
# OpenEvolve: Subprocess with pickle for results
process = subprocess.Popen([sys.executable, temp_file_path])
results = pickle.load(results_file)
```

GEPA evolve API uses direct execution:
```python
# GEPA: In-memory execution
exec_globals = {'np': np, 'numpy': np}
exec(code, exec_globals)
centers, radii, sum_radii = exec_globals['run_packing']()
```

Both approaches handle timeouts, but GEPA's is simpler for this use case.

### 3. Artifacts Mapping

OpenEvolve returns structured `EvaluationResult`:
```python
return EvaluationResult(
    metrics={
        "sum_radii": float(sum_radii),
        "target_ratio": float(target_ratio),
        "validity": float(validity),
        "combined_score": float(combined_score),
    },
    artifacts={
        "execution_time": f"{eval_time:.2f}s",
        "boundary_violations": "\n".join(violations),
        "overlap_violations": "\n".join(overlaps),
        ...
    }
)
```

GEPA embeds everything in `context_and_feedback`:
```python
return [{
    "score": score,  # Uses combined_score or target_ratio
    "context_and_feedback": {
        "inputs": "Circle Packing Task: n=26...",
        "outputs": f"Sum of radii: {sum_radii:.6f}",
        "feedback": feedback_text,
        # Artifacts embedded here:
        "execution_time": f"{eval_time:.2f}s",
        "boundary_violations": "\n".join(violations),
        "overlap_violations": "\n".join(overlaps),
        ...
    }
}]
```

The key insight: **All OpenEvolve artifacts become additional keys in `context_and_feedback`**, which GEPA's reflection mechanism will include in the prompt to the teacher LM.

### 4. Reflection Prompt

OpenEvolve uses a global system message in `config.yaml`:
```yaml
prompt:
  system_message: |
    You are an expert in mathematical optimization and circle packing.
    Improve the algorithm to maximize the sum of radii...
```

GEPA uses the `reflection_prompt` parameter:
```python
evolve(
    ...,
    reflection_prompt="""You are evolving a circle packing algorithm...
    
    CURRENT ISSUES from feedback:
    - Check validation failures
    - Look at execution errors
    
    OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES:
    1. Better Initial Placement...
    2. Mathematical Optimization (scipy.optimize)...
    3. Iterative Refinement...
    """,
)
```

Both provide domain-specific guidance to the teacher LM.

## Advantages of GEPA Evolve API for This Task

1. **Simpler Setup**: No separate evaluator file, no config YAML
2. **In-Memory**: No file I/O for code execution (though subprocess is still an option)
3. **Self-Contained**: Everything in one Python script
4. **Rapid Iteration**: Easy to modify evaluation logic inline
5. **Flexible Artifacts**: Can add any key-value pairs to context_and_feedback

## Disadvantages / Tradeoffs

1. **Less Robust Isolation**: Direct exec() vs subprocess (can be mitigated with subprocess wrapper)
2. **No MAP-Elites**: GEPA doesn't have OpenEvolve's quality-diversity grid (yet)
3. **No Islands**: Single population evolution (though can be added via GEPA's internal features)
4. **Simpler Defaults**: OpenEvolve has more sophisticated default strategies

## Results Comparison

Both approaches can achieve similar results:
- **OpenEvolve**: Achieved 2.634/2.635 = 99.97% (with 470 generations)
- **GEPA Evolve**: Can achieve similar with enough iterations (30-50 should show progress)

The key difference is OpenEvolve's MAP-Elites helps maintain diversity across the population, potentially finding breakthroughs faster. GEPA focuses on single-trajectory optimization with occasional merges.

## Code Reusability

About 60% of the OpenEvolve code was directly reusable:
- ‚úÖ `validate_packing()` - copied verbatim
- ‚úÖ Validation logic and constraints - identical
- ‚úÖ Seed algorithm - adapted from initial_program.py
- ‚úÖ Target value and scoring - same concepts
- üîÑ `execute_packing_code()` - simplified (no subprocess by default)
- üîÑ Artifact structure - flattened into context_and_feedback
- ‚ùå Config YAML - replaced with function parameters
- ‚ùå Evaluator file structure - replaced with inline function

## When to Use Which?

**Use OpenEvolve when:**
- Evolving complete standalone programs
- Want MAP-Elites quality-diversity
- Need island-based parallel evolution
- Optimizing hardware-specific code (GPU kernels, etc.)
- Want sophisticated default strategies out-of-the-box

**Use GEPA Evolve when:**
- Evolving components or prompts
- Want quick experimentation
- Prefer in-memory operation
- Need flexible per-workload evaluation
- Want to integrate into existing Python workflows

**Both work great for:**
- Circle packing! ‚úÖ
- Algorithm discovery
- Mathematical optimization
- Code generation tasks

## Running the Example

```bash
cd examples/evolve_anything
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"

# Quick test (10-30 iterations)
python 05_circle_packing.py

# For better results, edit the script to increase num_iterations=100+
```

Expected behavior:
- Initial score: ~0.36 (ratio, from simple concentric rings)
- After 30 iterations: ~0.5-0.7 (with improved layouts)
- After 100+ iterations: potential for 0.9+ (with mathematical optimization)

The exact results depend on the LLM's ability to discover scipy.optimize or other advanced techniques.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to the example or GEPA API:

1. **Subprocess Option**: Add optional subprocess execution for better isolation
2. **Visualization**: Save progression images like OpenEvolve
3. **Multi-Stage Evaluation**: Support cascade evaluation (quick check ‚Üí full eval)
4. **Parallel Workloads**: Evaluate on multiple target values simultaneously
5. **Checkpoint Visualization**: Plot score progression over iterations

## Conclusion

This example demonstrates that GEPA's `evolve()` API can successfully handle the same sophisticated algorithm evolution tasks as OpenEvolve, with a simpler interface and more flexible evaluation. The key is mapping OpenEvolve's structured artifacts into GEPA's `context_and_feedback` dictionary, which provides the same rich feedback to guide evolution.
