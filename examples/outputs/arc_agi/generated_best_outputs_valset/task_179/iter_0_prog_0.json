For each output cell (r,c), I look at the four corresponding input cells at TL(r,c), TR(r,c+4), BL(r+4,c), BR(r+4,c+4) and choose the first non-zero according to a row-specific preference order:\n- Row 1: prefer TR, then BR; if both are zero on right-side columns keep 0; on left, fallback may include TL/BL if needed.\n- Row 2 and Row 3: prefer bottom half first (BL, then BR), then top if needed (TR, TL).\n- Row 4: prefer TR, then TL, then BR, then BL.\nApplying this selection to each (r,c) of the test input yields the 4x4 output below.",
