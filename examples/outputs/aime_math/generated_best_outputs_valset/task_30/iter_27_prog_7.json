    "prompt": "Solve the math problem carefully and thoroughly. Your goal is to produce a correct, well\u2011structured solution that leads unambiguously to the requested final result.\n\nFollow these rules:\n\n1. Restate the problem briefly in your own words.\n   - Identify what is given and what must be found.\n   - Note any special conditions (e.g., ordering of variables, geometric configuration).\n\n2. Set up notation and equations cleanly before manipulating them.\n   - Define all variables explicitly (including any you introduce, like substitutions).\n   - State all constraints and domain conditions (positivity, integrality, ordering, angle ranges, etc.) before using them.\n   - When you make structural assumptions (e.g., \u201cassume all first k terms are equal\u201d), clearly justify why this does not reduce generality for maximizing/minimizing the desired expression.\n\n3. Plan the approach before detailed algebra.\n   - Briefly outline the main idea (e.g., symmetry, extremal principle, splitting into cases, using inequalities, introducing coordinates).\n   - For optimization / extremal problems, explain why your configuration is optimal (e.g., by convexity, rearrangement inequality, averaging arguments), not just by constructing one example.\n   - For existence/uniqueness, mention how you will show all solutions or the unique solution.\n\n4. Show clear, logically ordered reasoning.\n   - Justify each important algebraic, geometric, or inequality step.\n   - When you split into cases, state:\n     * why each case must be considered, and\n     * what assumptions define the case.\n   - If you invoke a known theorem or fact (e.g., Ptolemy, Power of a Point, Cauchy\u2013Schwarz, AM\u2013GM, similarity, Vieta, extremal principle), name it and show explicitly how it applies in this context.\n   - For inequality / optimization problems, be explicit about:\n     * where equalities can occur,\n     * why boundary or extreme configurations are considered,\n     * and why they indeed give a global optimum under the constraints.\n\n5. Handle dead ends correctly.\n   - If a line of reasoning leads to a contradiction or dead end, explicitly say so.\n   - Roll back to the last correct point and choose a new approach; do not keep using a flawed assumption.\n   - Do not discard potential solutions without checking them against all given conditions.\n\n6. Keep the reasoning focused but rigorous.\n   - Avoid unnecessary numerical approximations when an exact expression is available.\n   - Do not approximate exact values unless the problem explicitly asks for a decimal or numerical estimate.\n   - Prefer structural or conceptual arguments (symmetry, convexity, parity, monotonicity, invariants, etc.) over ad hoc trial\u2011and\u2011error or guess\u2011and\u2011check.\n   - You may test specific candidate values only after deriving strong constraints that sharply limit the possibilities, and you must explain why those candidates are exhaustive.\n\n7. Treat ordering and extremal indices with care.\n   - For sequences with ordering constraints (e.g., \\(x_1 \\le \\dots \\le x_n\\)), reason about which indices must be negative, zero, or positive to maximize or minimize a given difference.\n   - When you set many consecutive terms equal (e.g., all smallest terms equal to some \\(b\\), all largest terms equal to some \\(a\\), and middle ones zero), justify that any deviation from this would decrease (or not increase) the desired quantity, using monotonicity or averaging arguments.\n   - Ensure that sign and ordering constraints are respected in all constructed examples.\n\n8. Final consistency check.\n   - At the end, verify that your solution satisfies:\n     * all original equations/constraints,\n     * ordering or geometric conditions,\n     * and any side conditions (e.g., angle ranges, positivity, distinctness).\n   - For maximization/minimization problems, explicitly argue that:\n     * your value is attainable by some configuration, and\n     * no configuration can exceed (or go below) it.\n\n9. At the end, clearly isolate the answer:\n   - Provide the final answer as a single number or expression on its own line.\n   - Do not include any extra words, symbols, or explanation on that final line.",
