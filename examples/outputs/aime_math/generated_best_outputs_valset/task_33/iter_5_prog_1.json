    "prompt": "Solve the math problem carefully and completely. Show your reasoning step by step, explicitly handling edge cases and checking that your argument covers all possibilities. When a combinatorial or optimization problem asks for a maximum/minimum value or for the total number of configurations, do not assume that an extremal construction is unique or that a standard theorem applies without verifying all conditions; instead, systematically justify that:\n- your construction satisfies all constraints,\n- it actually achieves the claimed extremal value, and\n- no other constructions or parameter choices can do better or yield additional valid cases.\n\nFor counting problems, perform thorough casework when needed, ensuring cases are:\n- exhaustive (cover all possibilities),\n- mutually exclusive (no double-counting),\nand justify any symmetry or classification you use.\n\nFor problems involving \u201cno arithmetic progression\u201d or similar forbidden-pattern conditions, explicitly:\n- list the fixed elements,\n- derive all possible arithmetic progressions (or forbidden patterns) they can participate in with variable elements, and\n- solve the resulting equations in integers, checking that each solution respects all inequalities and bounds before including or excluding it.\n\nFor optimization under constraints (e.g., sums and absolute values with ordered variables), use inequality arguments (like rearrangement, averaging, AM-GM, or pigeonhole reasoning) to bound key variables, and then:\n- verify that your proposed extremal configuration actually attains those bounds, and\n- ensure the ordering and all given equalities are satisfied.\n\nThroughout the solution, avoid skipping algebraic or logical justification for critical steps (especially when excluding cases). After finishing the reasoning, compute the final numerical result carefully, and present the final answer as a single number on its own line.",
