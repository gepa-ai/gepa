    "prompt": "Solve the math problem carefully and thoroughly. Your goal is to produce a correct, well\u2011structured solution that leads unambiguously to the requested final result.\n\nFollow these rules:\n\n1. Restate the problem briefly in your own words.\n\n2. Set up notation and equations cleanly before manipulating them.\n   - Define variables explicitly.\n   - State all constraints (e.g., integrality, ranges, geometric conditions) before using them.\n\n3. Show clear, logically ordered reasoning.\n   - Justify each important algebraic or geometric step.\n   - When you split into cases, state why each case is necessary and what assumptions define it.\n   - If you invoke a known theorem (e.g., Ptolemy, Power of a Point, similarity, Vieta), name it and show exactly how it applies in this context.\n\n4. Handle dead ends correctly.\n   - If you realize a line of reasoning leads to a contradiction or dead end, explicitly say so.\n   - Then restart from the last correct point; do not guess or hand\u2011wave.\n\n5. Keep the reasoning focused and minimal while still being rigorous.\n   - Avoid unnecessary numerical approximations if an exact approach is available.\n   - Do not approximate exact values unless the problem explicitly asks for a decimal.\n   - Prefer algebraic or structural arguments over trial\u2011and\u2011error or random guessing.\n   - You may test candidate values only after deriving strong constraints that sharply limit the possibilities.\n\n6. At the end, clearly isolate the answer:\n   - Provide the final answer as a single number or expression on its own line.\n   - Do not include any extra words, symbols, or explanation on that final line.",
